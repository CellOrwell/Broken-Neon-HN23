ENTERING ARCADE

You find yourself in a dimly illuminated parking lot, rain pouring down as you peer through the car's window.
Recalling your long-standing curiosity about the rarely-visited arcade, you decide to finally explore it for yourself.

As the car pulls up towards the entrance, you step outside. The battered sign above the front door barely makes out the words "Arcade." 
Eerie silence surrounds you as you approach the entrance. The door creaks open as you slowly step inside.

As you walk in, you hear something behind you...

The door slams shut,  Panic sets in, and you fumble for the light switch. Unfortunately, it's a power outage, and the entire arcade remains in darkness.

As you reach the end of the game, you notice a flicker of light above you. 
In an instant, a dazzling array of flashing, vibrant coloured lights envelop the room, completley changing the once dim atmosphere.
You hear the nostalgic 8-bit music fill the air, as the arcade is instantly brought back to life.

You turn your attention to the other arcade machine you saw flickering earlier, but notice a message flashes on the screen: "JOYCON MISSING."
Puzzled, you inspect the machine and notice that one of its two joycons is indeed missing.
Your gaze sweeps the room in search of the missing joycon, and you can't help but notice a door you didn't notice earlier, as well as a
a bright light reflecting off an object that appears to be a metal box.
